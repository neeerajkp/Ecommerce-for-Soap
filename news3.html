            <h3><u>Benefits of Using Natural Soap</u></h3>
            <h4>There are several benefits to using natural soap, including:</h4>
            <h3><u>1. Real Soap Instead of "Fake Soap"</u></h3>
            <h4>Many products that are advertised or displayed using terms like ‘cleanser,’ ‘body bar,’ ‘body wash,’
                ‘beauty bar,’ ‘skincare bar,’ and even ‘deodorant soap’ are actually detergent based products, and not
                really soaps at all.</h4>
            <h3><u>2. Natural Soap is Highly Moisturising</u></h3>
            <h4>One of the benefits of using real soap is that one of the by-products of the production process is
                glycerine. Glycerine is an excellent skin moisturiser because it attracts moisture to itself in and
                around the skin. Traditionally made soaps contain glycerine, and so they hydrate the skin during
                bathing, whereas many commercially manufactured soaps can dry skin out. Why? Because store-bought,
                commercial soaps usually undergo a process designed specifically to remove the glycerine.</h4>
            <h3><u>3. Better Ingredients Used</u></h3>
            <h4>When a company manufactures hundreds of thousands, or even millions of bars of soap at a time, part of
                the profit margin is gained from mass production, and part is gained from using the cheapest products
                available – and these are often synthetic substitutes for the real thing.</h4>
            <h4>Many believe that these synthetic products can sometimes be damaging to the endocrine, reproductive,
                respiratory and immune systems – not to mention the potential damage they do by drying out your skin.
            </h4>
            <h4>Commercial soaps are known to regularly contain Parabens, Sulphates, and Triclosan, which are thought to
                trigger allergies, to influence hormone levels, and possibly increase risk of some cancers.</h4>
            <h4>Natural soaps, however, usually use natural ingredients like olive and coconut oils, shea butter, and
                grass-fed tallow. These are believed to be very healthy and nourishing for the skin.</h4>
            <h3><u>4. Cruelty-Free and Animal-Friendly</u></h3>
            <h4>Another great benefit of natural, organic soaps is that you can rest assured they are not hurting any
                animals in the testing or production phases. Ingredients are almost always exclusively plant-based (some
                soaps use animal fat as an ingredient, thought this is rare), are organic, and do not require
                large-scale factories and other facilities that cause widespread environmental damage.</h4>
            <h3><u>5. Wider Choice</u></h3>
            <h4>As mentioned above, organic soaps are normally made in small batches by a local producer. Small batches
                not only mean easier control, but also a wider variety of products. Each batch is easily changed to a
                new scent or style without having to retool large factory equipment. These soaps are therefore easily
                customisable too. Colour, shape, size, grainy or smooth texture, scent, batch size, and other features
                are frequently changed to provide maximum choice for the consumer. You can even buy organic soaps in
                coffee, cinnamon, peppermint, or fruit scents!</h4>
            <h3><u>6. Unique, Handmade Product</u></h3>
            <h4>Mass-produced commercial soaps are made for efficiency of production, which means many, many, units of
                the exact same size and composition. Focus is on profit, often at the expense of the health of the
                consumers who pay for them. Organic bars are different in that they do vary slightly from bar to bar,
                just as natural ingredients vary slightly depending on a given year’s weather and other conditions.
                Where they do not vary, however, is in the lack of harmful ingredients and the abundance of healthy ones
                that are in each bar.</h4>
            <h3><u>7. Better for the Environment</u></h3>
            <h4>Organic soaps do not produce harmful environmental poisons or toxins. The soap breaks down more easily
                after use and does not harm the water cycle or the wildlife that shares the water in our rivers, lakes,
                and the oceans. This eco-friendliness would be a strong argument for using organic soaps, even if all
                else was equal. Add to it the great quality and efficacy of the soaps, and the pleasure you get from a
                more unique product, and they are a clear winner.</h4>
